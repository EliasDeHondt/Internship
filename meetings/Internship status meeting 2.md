# Internship status meeting 2

## Report

In our meeting, we spent most of the time talking about our Mount Pleasant network overhaul project with Piet Boedt, our coach from KdG. We explained everything we’ve done so far, going over all the steps we’ve completed and sharing our plans for what we’ll do next. We made sure to cover our goals and how we plan to reach them. Piet was really happy with how much we’ve accomplished and loved how we’re keeping detailed records of our work. He said our clear documentation will make it easy to pass our work to the rest of the team later on.

Piet also shared some ideas about how KdG handles its IT systems, especially when it comes to keeping things secure. He talked about the ways they protect their networks and gave us simple examples of how they do it. His advice helped us understand how we can make our project even better by thinking about security in a similar way. The conversation was open and encouraging, and Piet’s kind words made us feel confident about our progress. It also reminded us to keep focusing on good documentation and working closely with our team.

## Conclusion

Overall, this was another positive meeting. We are on track with our project and have received valuable feedback from Piet. We will continue to work on our documentation and keep the team informed of our progress.
