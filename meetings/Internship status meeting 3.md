# Internship status meeting 3

## Report

We began the meeting by reviewing our self-assessments and the mid-term evaluations written by Joe McMorrow. Our coach from KdG, Piet Boedt, was pleased with both. He appreciated the positive feedback in Joeâ€™s assessments and found our self-assessments honest and thorough. Additionally, Piet enjoyed reading our blogs and expressed interest in seeing the final photos of our overhaul.

Piet stressed the need for comprehensive documentation to facilitate a seamless handover of our work to the team, warning that inadequate documentation could waste our efforts. Fortunately, we are already documenting every aspect of our work and actively involving the team to keep them updated on our progress, which should make the handover easier.

## TODO

- We should read up on the following topics:
  - ITIL
  - Change management
- We should communicate the date and time of our presentation about the internship with Joe McMorrow.

## Conclusion

Overall, the meeting was productive. We received positive feedback on our self-assessments and mid-term evaluations, and we are on track with our documentation efforts. We will continue to work on our TODO list and keep the team informed of our progress.
