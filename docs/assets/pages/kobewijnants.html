                    the first week was quite chaotic. the person responsible for getting us started on our
                    project was on vacation, and their replacements had no prior information about our assignment. this
                    led to some confusion and delays, making it difficult to get up to speed right away. also it became
                    clear that the projects that we agreed on before the start of the internship were not possible, this
                    stressed me out a bit...

                <p class="blog-post-text">
                    despite these challenges, we did manage to get a guided tour of the campus and an overview
                    of the existing networking infrastructure. the network itself is a complete mess — previous it staff
                    implemented a lot of questionable configurations, and most of the infrastructure is outdated and at
                    the end of its lifecycle. however, this gave me a chance to learn more about network design,
                    troubleshooting, and the importance of proper documentation.

                    on thursday our projects became concrete and we had a meeting with our kdg coach piet boedt and joe
                    mcmorrow about our first week and what we would be doing. hopefully, we can build on this and start
                    making real progress in the coming weeks.

                    we kicked off our second week by continuing the documentation of the existing network at the mount
                    pleasant campus. this process helps us identify which parts of the network need to be redesigned or
                    reconfigured.

                    on tuesday morning, we headed up to the loft at mount pleasant to inspect the networking rack again.
                    it was quite a mess—lots of unused and pinched cables, along with several questionable design
                    choices.

                <p class="blog-post-text">
                    in the afternoon, we documented all our findings and began working on a python script to monitor
                    vlan traffic. this will help us determine if any vlans are overloaded with too many access points.

                    thursday we completed our documentation of the mount pleasant building, we've succesfully identified
                    every device on all of the ports. using this information we can start designing a new configuration

                    we will discuss our findings and our recommandations for the network.

                    our third week was a relaxed one, as we had a day off due to the "bank holidays" in the uk. during
                    this week we tried to finish our documentation to then start planning how the new network should
                    work.

                <p class="blog-post-text">
                    we also had an insightful meeting with nick verdegem, the university’s enterprise architect. he
                    shared valuable context about the ongoing digital transformation and the challenges inherited from
                    previous teams. during the meeting, we presented our findings and outlined our plans for the coming
                    weeks. nick seemed genuinely enthusiastic about our ideas.

                    as we wrapped up the documentation phase of our project, we revisited the mount pleasant network to
                    take some initial photos. while exploring the existing setup, we came across a particularly odd
                    configuration on a windows dhcp server. it first assigns a pool of addresses, then blacklists the
                    entire range, and finally reserves a single address from that same pool for a specific mac address.
                    this unconventional setup makes connecting new devices to the network unnecessarily complicated.

                    the monday of our fourth week was another "bank holiday" so we started our
                    week on tuesday, we had a look at the franciscian building where the second ups would be installed
                    this was again a very unconventional server rack with many unexplainable bad practices.

                    on wednesday we had a meeting with piet boedt where we told him how everything
                    was going the last few weeks. we also told him what we were going to do in the next couple of weeks.

                    on thursday i documented all of the servers in the server subnet, this way we
                    could get an idea of what was running right now and what could be removed in the future. this was
                    also handy to get an ideo of what services where connected to the mount pleasant network.

                    on friday we deployed an application called "netbox" this application could
                    transform our excel that we made during the documentation phase in to a dashboard that can fully
                    explain the whole network.

                    even though this is labeled "week 3," this week actually marks our fifth week at the internship.
                    time is flying by quickly as we continue to make progress on improving the university’s networking
                    infrastructure.

                <p class="blog-post-text">
                    one of our main focuses this week was improving the current dhcp and dns setup. the current
                    configuration runs on a old windows server, and we’re working on creating a more modern,
                    scalable solution that’s easier to manage and debug.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-post-text">
                    a major highlight of the week was a strategic meeting with joe, nick (the enterprise architect), and
                    trevor (the it manager). together, we discussed the future of the mount pleasant network and the
                    possibility of switching it over to a unifi setup. it was a productive session where we evaluated
                    three possible scenarios:
                <ol>
                    <li>optimizing the current infrastructure</li>
                    <li>partial migration to unifi</li>
                    <li>full migration to unifi</li>

                <p class="blog-post-text">
                    as a result of this meeting, we were asked to prepare a presentation summarizing all available
                    options, their pros and cons, and what implementation might look like.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-post-text">
                    toward the end of the week, we explored a potential proof-of-concept unifi setup. this hands-on
                    testing environment will help us validate if unifi can meet the university's performance,
                    manageability, and scalability needs before committing to a larger migration.

                <p class="blog-post-text">
                        This week, we worked on an exciting side project at a former church converted into a lecture hall, known as "The Radcliffe Centre" (search it on Google!). Multiple reports highlighted "unusable" Wi-Fi in the building, so we investigated. Upon arrival, we conducted a speed test and found the connection never exceeded 45 MBit/s—insufficient for a venue hosting over 100 students simultaneously. We discovered that the DSL line entering the building was capped at 45 MBit/s. While there, we also tidied the network rack, removing outdated, unused hardware.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-post-text">
                        On Thursday, we met with Piet, our coach from KDG. We reviewed our self-assessments and the report Joe wrote about us. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, which was great to hear.
