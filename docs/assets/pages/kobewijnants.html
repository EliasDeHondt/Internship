                    <p class="post-text">
                        The first week was quite chaotic. The person responsible for getting us started on our
                        project was on vacation, and their replacements had no prior information about our assignment. This
                        led to some confusion and delays, making it difficult to get up to speed right away. Also it became
                        clear that the projects that we agreed on before the start of the internship were not possible, this
                        stressed me out a bit...

                    <p class="post-text">
                        Despite these challenges, we did manage to get a guided tour of the campus and an overview
                        of the existing networking infrastructure. The network itself is a complete mess — previous IT staff
                        implemented a lot of questionable configurations, and most of the infrastructure is outdated and at
                        the end of its lifecycle. However, this gave me a chance to learn more about network design,
                        troubleshooting, and the importance of proper documentation.

                        On thursday our projects became concrete and we had a meeting with our KdG coach Piet Boedt and Joe
                        McMorrow about our first week and what we would be doing. Hopefully, we can build on this and start
                        making real progress in the coming weeks.

                    <h2 class="blog-title">Easter Holidays Week 1</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">
                        We kicked off our second week by continuing the documentation of the existing network at the Mount
                        Pleasant campus. This process helps us identify which parts of the network need to be redesigned or
                        reconfigured.

                        On Tuesday morning, we headed up to the loft at Mount Pleasant to inspect the networking rack again.
                        It was quite a mess—lots of unused and pinched cables, along with several questionable design
                        choices (see pictures).

                    <p class="post-text">
                        In the afternoon, we documented all our findings and began working on a Python script to monitor
                        VLAN traffic. This will help us determine if any VLANs are overloaded with too many access points.
