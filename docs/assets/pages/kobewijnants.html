                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        The first week was quite chaotic. 
                        The person responsible for getting us started on our project was on vacation, and their replacements had no prior information about our assignment. 
                        This led to some confusion and delays, making it difficult to get up to speed right away. 
                        Also it became clear that the projects that we agreed on before the start of the internship were not possible, this stressed me out a bit...

                    <br>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        Despite these challenges, we did manage to get a guided tour of the campus and an overview of the existing networking infrastructure. 
                        The network itself is a complete mess — previous it staff implemented a lot of questionable configurations, and most of the infrastructure is outdated and at the end of its lifecycle. 
                        However, this gave me a chance to learn more about network design, troubleshooting, and the importance of proper documentation.

                        Hopefully, we can build on this and start making real progress in the coming weeks.

                        We kicked off our second week by continuing the documentation of the existing network at the mount pleasant campus. 
                        This process helps us identify which parts of the network need to be redesigned or reconfigured.

                        On tuesday morning, we headed up to the loft at mount pleasant to inspect the networking rack again.
                        It was quite a mess—lots of unused and pinched cables, along with several questionable design choices.

                        In the afternoon, we documented all our findings and began working on a python script to monitor vlan traffic. 
                        This will help us determine if any vlans are overloaded with too many access points.

                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        Our third week was a relaxed one, as we had a day off due to the "bank holidays" in the uk. 
                        During this week we tried to finish our documentation to then start planning how the new network should work.

                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        We also had an insightful meeting with Nick Verdegem, the university’s enterprise architect. 
                        He shared valuable context about the ongoing digital transformation and the challenges inherited from previous teams. 
                        during the meeting, we presented our findings and outlined our plans for the coming weeks. 
                        Nick seemed genuinely enthusiastic about our ideas.

                        As we wrapped up the documentation phase of our project, we revisited the mount pleasant network to take some initial photos. 
                        While exploring the existing setup, we came across a particularly odd configuration on a windows dhcp server. 
                        It first assigns a pool of addresses, then blacklists the entire range, and finally reserves a single address from that same pool for a specific mac address.
                        This unconventional setup makes connecting new devices to the network unnecessarily complicated.

                        The monday of our fourth week was another "bank holiday" so we started our week on tuesday, we had a look at the franciscian building where the second ups would be installed this was again a very unconventional server rack with many unexplainable bad practices.

                        On thursday i documented all of the servers in the server subnet, this way we could get an idea of what was running right now and what could be removed in the future. 
                        This was also handy to get an ideo of what services where connected to the mount pleasant network.

                        Even though this is labeled "Week 3", this week actually marks our fifth week at the internship.
                        Time is flying by quickly as we continue to make progress on improving the university’s networking infrastructure.

                        One of our main focuses this week was improving the current dhcp and dns setup. 
                        The current configuration runs on a old windows server, and we’re working on creating a more modern, scalable solution that’s easier to manage and debug.

                        A major highlight of the week was a strategic meeting with Joe, Nick (the enterprise architect), and trevor (the it manager).
                        Together, we discussed the future of the mount pleasant network and the possibility of switching it over to a UniFi setup. 
                        It was a productive session where we evaluated three possible scenarios:
                        <ol class="blog-post-text-ol">
                            <li class="blog-post-text-li">Optimizing the current infrastructure</li>

                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        As a result of this meeting, we were asked to prepare a presentation summarizing all available options, their pros and cons, and what implementation might look like.

                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        Toward the end of the week, we explored a potential proof-of-concept UniFi setup. 
                        This hands-on testing environment will help us validate if UniFi can meet the university's performance, manageability, and scalability needs before committing to a larger migration.

                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        This week, we worked on an exciting side project at a former church converted into a lecture hall, known as "The Radcliffe Centre" (search it on Google!). 
                        Multiple reports highlighted "unusable" Wi-Fi in the building, so we investigated. 
                        Upon arrival, we conducted a speed test and found the connection never exceeded 45 MBit/s—insufficient for a venue hosting over 100 students simultaneously. 
                        We discovered that the DSL line entering the building was capped at 45 MBit/s. 
                        While there, we also tidied the network rack, removing outdated, unused hardware.

                        Early this week, we met with Lynx Networks, experts in cabling and network device configuration. 
                        The discussion focused on the university's comprehensive network overhaul.

                        At the end of the week, we presented the full Mount Pleasant project to Joe, Nick, and Trevor. We walked them through our plans, discussed the available options, and highlighted the key roadblocks we’ve encountered.
                        We evaluated two main paths: optimizing the existing infrastructure or migrating to UniFi. 
                        At this stage, we’re leaning toward a UniFi migration, but we plan to validate this direction by setting up a proof-of-concept at Mount Pleasant.
                        Overall, the presentation went very well—they shared the same impression. Trevor even rated it a 9.5 out of 10.

                        This week was a productive one. Monday we moved the network of the gym in Mount Pleasant to a seperate rack (see the gallery for pictures). 
                        This way the 2 logical networks are now also physically separated.

                        This was a very cool event where UniFi showed us some unreleased products and what there mission is for the future.
                        They made it very obvious that they are going to focus on the enterprise market, which is perfect for our use case.

                        It quickly became clear during the meeting that the current network infrastructure is not suitable for future needs and will require significant changes.

                        Despite this, we immediately focused on getting the fiber connection between Mount Pleasant and the Franciscan Building operational.
                        This improvement will enhance redundancy the Mount Pleasant Campus.

                        On Friday, we experienced a major outage that began around 11:50 and lasted until 18:20. The root cause was a failure of the VMware hypervisors, though the exact reason is still under investigation.
                        As a result, critical services—including DHCP, DNS, and RADIUS—were unavailable throughout the entire duration. 
                        These services depended on other servers with datastores that became inaccessible during the incident, which is why it took so long to resolve.
