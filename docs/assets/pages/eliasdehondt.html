                    <h2 class="blog-title">Week 1</h2>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        The first week was a bit of a whirlwind, to put it mildly. 
                        The people who were supposed to guide me were off enjoying their vacation, and their replacements didn’t seem quite ready to step in. 
                        So, I found myself spending most of my time researching network monitoring tools on my own and getting familiar with the university. 
                        One highlight, though, was that we got a full tour of all three campuses, which was a great way to see the lay of the land. 
                        It was a lot to take in, but it definitely helped me get a sense of the place. 
                        The staff situation, though? Not exactly ideal—things felt a bit disorganized with the regular crew away and the stand-ins still finding their footing.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        It wasn’t the smoothest start, but it wasn’t a total loss either. 
                        That first week ended up being more about exploration than anything else. 
                        Besides the campus tour, I spent time getting to know everyone, signing a stack of paperwork, and sorting out contracts to get everything in order. 
                        Even with the chaos, I managed to learn a bunch about the network—turns out it’s not in the best shape, so there’s plenty to tackle. 
                        It was also a chance to pick up on the team’s vibe and figure out how everyone fits together. 
                        All in all, Week 1 was a bit all over the place, but it gave me a solid starting point to build from.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        Things started looking up by Thursday, though. 
                        We had a meeting with Piet De Boedt, and we finally got the chance to talk to him about our network project. 
                        Up until then, it was all a bit vague, but Thursday was when it started to get concrete. 
                        Joe, our contact person here at the university, was a huge help with this. 
                        He really stepped up and made sure we could finally kick things off. 
                        Thanks to Piet and Joe, we got a clear direction, and by Friday, we even got to visit the campus to take a first look at how the network is set up over there. 
                        It felt good to finally have something solid to dig into after a shaky start. 
                        All in all, Week 1 was a bit all over the place, but it gave me a solid starting point to build from.

                    <h2 class="blog-title">Easter Holidays Week 1</h2>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        The first week of Easter holidays was all about diving into some hands-on work, and it felt good to finally get stuck into something technical. 
                        We spent most of our time working on a Python script that the team here can dynamically apply to different scenarios. 
                        The goal was to create something flexible—something they could use to pull statistics from various sources and display them right on their dashboard. 
                        It’s still a work in progress, but by the end of the week, we had a solid foundation that could read and process data in a way that’s actually useful for them.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        On top of that, we started building a monitoring tool that’s shaping up to be pretty cool. 
                        It’s an executable that lets them log into a switch or router and pull all sorts of info—like interface statuses, performance stats, you name it. 
                        The idea is to give them a quick, easy way to check on the network without digging through a million menus or command lines. 
                        We got the basics working, and it’s already pulling some live data, which was exciting to see. 
                        There’s still some polishing to do, but it’s definitely coming together.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        We also took a trip to Mount Pleasant this week, which was a nice change of pace. 
                        The visit was all about gathering more info for our documentation and digging deeper into the analysis phase of our project. 
                        It was a chance to see some of the network setup in action and take a few “before” pictures—you can check those out in the images section if you’re curious. 
                        The whole experience gave us a better grasp of what we’re working with and helped tie our coding efforts back to the real-world network. 
                        On top of that, we got a fun surprise this week: a new office! It used to belong to the manager who was supposed to welcome us, which we found pretty amusing. 
                        Together with Joe McMorrow, we had a great time pimping it out to make it our own—check out the photos in the <a class="cursor-pointer" href="https://eliasdehondt.github.io/Internship/assets/pages/images.html">gallery</a> to see the results! 
                        All in all, it was a productive week that balanced coding, fieldwork, and a bit of office flair—definitely a step up from the chaos of Week 1!

                    <h2 class="blog-title">Easter Holidays Week 2</h2>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        The second week of the Easter holidays was noticeably quieter, mainly because it was a short four-day week—Friday was a public holiday here in the UK. 
                        That gave us a chance to step back and focus on other things for a day, which was a nice break. 
                        The four days we were on-site, though, were pretty low-key but still productive in their own way.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        We wrapped up the last bits of documentation needed for Mount Pleasant, which felt good to finally check off. 
                        More excitingly, we got access to the DHCP servers running on their Windows servers, which also host their Active Directory. 
                        This gave us the chance to dig into how their DHCP setup works, and we were able to confirm our theory about its structure. 
                        As we suspected, it’s not exactly implemented in the best way—static IPs and static MAC addresses are being used in a pretty unusual setup. 
                        The old team, who are no longer here, claimed this was for “security,” but as we all know, obscurity doesn’t equal security. 
                        It’s a strange way of doing things, to say the least.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        By the end of the week, we’d fully mapped out the network and put together our suggestions for improvements, which are now mostly fleshed out. 
                        There are still a few minor details to iron out, but those can wait until Monday. 
                        With everything coming together, the next step is to start planning downtime to implement our changes and take over our part of the network. 
                        It’s starting to feel like we’re building toward something big, and I’m looking forward to seeing how it all comes together next week!

                    <h2 class="blog-title">Week 2</h2>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        Week 2 kicked off with a public holiday on Monday, which gave us a chance to enjoy some fantastic weather and take a well-deserved break. 
                        The rest of the week, however, was packed with work as we dove back into the project with renewed focus.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        Most of our time was spent on documentation, which is starting to feel like a never-ending task, but it’s crucial for keeping everything organized. 
                        We also had the chance to visit one of the server rooms with Joe, which was an eye-opener. 
                        The setup there was a bit chaotic—outdated equipment, messy cabling, and a dire need for modernization. 
                        Our main task in that space will be installing a new UPS to ensure better power reliability for the network. 
                        It’s clear there’s a lot of work to be done to bring things up to standard, but it’s exciting to have such a tangible goal to work toward.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        We also had another productive meeting with Joe and Piet De Boedt, and I’m happy to say Piet seemed genuinely pleased with our progress. 
                        He gave us some feedback about refining our approach to subnets, which was super helpful, but overall, he seemed to think we’re on the right track. 
                        On top of that, we got some interesting insights from Nick Verdagem, a temporary network architect here. 
                        He suggested that introducing Docker and Kubernetes (K8s) could be a game-changer for the team, as everything is currently running on Windows-based services, which isn’t the most efficient. 
                        Nick also recommended looking into NetBox for better documentation management, so I’ve started exploring that and plan to wrap up my initial research by the end of this week. 
                        It’s been a busy but rewarding week, and it feels like we’re starting to make a real impact!

                    <h2 class="blog-title">Week 3</h2>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        Week 3 was a big one for tying up loose ends and pushing our project forward. 
                        We finally wrapped up all the documentation for the Mount Pleasant location, which means we now have a complete picture of the network setup there. 
                        It’s a huge relief to have that done, as it gives us a solid foundation to work from as we move into the implementation phase.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        With the documentation complete, we shifted our focus to planning the changes we want to make. 
                        The network at Mount Pleasant is, frankly, a bit of a mess, so we’ve put together a detailed plan to reorganize it. 
                        This includes introducing new VLANs with corresponding subnets to improve segmentation and efficiency. 
                        We also noticed that there are two separate networks housed in the same racks, which is causing unnecessary complexity and potential conflicts. 
                        Our plan is to physically and logically separate these to streamline operations. 
                        On top of that, we’re looking at physically reorganizing the network infrastructure to clean up the cabling and equipment layout—it’s long overdue for a makeover.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        We had a productive meeting with Nick Verdegem, Trevor Powis, and Joe McMorrow to discuss our proposed changes. 
                        They were on board with our ideas, and we’re now working on a formal document that outlines everything in detail. 
                        This will give us something concrete to present and discuss next week—likely Tuesday or Wednesday, since Monday is a public holiday in the UK. 
                        We also explored Ubiquiti’s UniFi system and recommended it for their network management needs. The team liked the idea, and they’re now ordering demo materials to test it out, which is exciting news. 
                        On a more technical note, I spent some time working on a Kubernetes (K8s) configuration file in YAML format for NetBox, including plugins to enhance its documentation capabilities. 
                        This should make it easier for the team to keep track of their network assets moving forward. 
                        On a personal note, I had a bit of a mishap at the gym and ended up with a cut near my eye. 
                        I visited the Milton Keynes University Hospital, the closest facility to Buckingham since there’s no hospital in Buckingham itself, and spent about three hours there getting it checked and treated. 
                        It’s nothing too serious, just a minor setback that should heal in a week or so. 
                        Overall, it was a busy and productive week, and I’m excited to see our plans start to take shape!

                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        Week 4 started with a public holiday on Monday, giving us a nice break to recharge before diving back into work. 
                        The rest of the week was spent at The Radcliffe Centre, a fascinating converted church now used as a large hall for various events. 
                        Our task there was to tidy up the network setup, and it turned out to be a refreshing side project that kept us engaged.

                        The network at The Radcliffe Centre is relatively small but needed some attention. 
                        It consists of four cameras, one door access system, one access point (AP), and a network switch. 
                        We spent time reorganizing the cabling and equipment to make everything neater and more efficient—check out the before-and-after photos in the <a class="cursor-pointer" href="https://eliasdehondt.github.io/Internship/assets/pages/images.html">gallery</a> to see the transformation! 
                        We also drafted a new plan to optimize the network, focusing on better segmentation and reliability. 
                        It was a pleasant project that felt like a nice breather amidst our larger tasks, and we had a bit of fun tackling it.

                        Alongside this, we’re gearing up for a big meeting with the IT director on Friday of Week 5 to get approval for our main project. 
                        This meeting will be crucial for moving forward, so we’re making sure all our documentation and proposals are ready. 
                        In the meantime, I’ve been tasked with creating a website for IT corporate information, which I’ve been working on in parallel. 
                        It’s still in the early stages, but it’s exciting to take on a web development project alongside the network tasks. 
                        Overall, Week 4 was productive and varied, with a good mix of hands-on work, planning, and some creative side tasks to keep things interesting!

                        Week 5 was a busy one, with a mix of web development and building important industry connections. 
                        A big part of my time was spent working on the Corporate Information website for the university’s IT department. 
                        Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I developed a clean and functional demo, which is now hosted on GitHub.

                        On top of the web development, I’ve been working hard to build a strong relationship with Dan Heath from Ubiquiti/UniFi/UI. 
                        My goal is to establish a solid partnership between the University of Buckingham and Ubiquiti before we wrap up our internship. 
                        Drawing on my existing professional connections with several people at Ubiquiti from my business experience, I’ve been able to make good progress. 
                        The university had tried to work with Ubiquiti in the past without success, but I’m confident we’re close to making this happen. 
                        It’s been a lot of communication and coordination, but it’s exciting to see it coming together.

                        I’m also making arrangements for Kobe, Joe, and myself to attend the UniFi World Conference in London next week, which would be an amazing opportunity to network and learn more about Ubiquiti’s solutions. 
                        You can find more details about the event <a class="cursor-pointer" href="https://uwc.ui.com" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                        It’s been a hectic week juggling the website project, the Ubiquiti partnership, and planning for the conference, but it feels like we’re making a real impact. 
                        The meeting with the IT director on Friday also went well, and we’re now waiting for final approval to move forward with our main project. 
                        All in all, it was a productive and exciting week!

                    <h2 class="blog-title">Week 6</h2>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        Week 6 was an action-packed week with a mix of hands-on network upgrades, an exciting industry event, and significant progress on core network documentation. 
                        On Monday, we were back at Mount Pleasant, focusing on a major network overhaul. Our task was to relocate the gym’s network infrastructure to a separate rack to improve organization and reduce congestion. 
                        We carefully moved the equipment, reconfigured connections, and thoroughly tested everything to ensure it was still operational. 
                        The process also involved updating our documentation to reflect the new setup—check out the before-and-after photos in the <a class="cursor-pointer" href="https://eliasdehondt.github.io/Internship/assets/pages/images.html">gallery</a> to see the transformation! 
                        It was satisfying to see the network at Mount Pleasant looking cleaner and more efficient by the end of the day.

                        Tuesday was a highlight of the week as we attended the UniFi World Conference (UWC) 2025 in London from 7:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 
                        The event was incredible—packed with insights, networking opportunities, and even some cool swag! We received free t-shirts, enjoyed a great lunch, and were gifted a network switch, which was a nice bonus. 
                        The conference featured a keynote from Ubiquiti’s CEO, who shared their vision for the future of networking, along with technical sessions that gave us valuable ideas for our project. 
                        We also made some great connections with industry professionals, which will be helpful as we push for a partnership between the University of Buckingham and Ubiquiti. 
                        Photos from the event are available in the <a class="cursor-pointer" href="https://eliasdehondt.github.io/Internship/assets/pages/images.html">gallery</a>, and you can learn more about the conference <a class="cursor-pointer" href="https://uwc.ui.com" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                        It was an inspiring day that left us energized for the rest of the week.

                        On Thursday, we shifted gears to focus on core network documentation, specifically improving IP routing to add redundancy across multiple sites. 
                        Previously, the routing setup was: Yeomanry → JISC, with Vinson Centre, Franciscan, Chandos Road, and Mount Pleasant all routing to Yeomanry. 
                        To enhance reliability, we reconfigured it to: Yeomanry → JISC, Vinson Centre → Yeomanry, Franciscan → Yeomanry & Mount Pleasant, Chandos Road → Yeomanry & Franciscan, and Mount Pleasant → Yeomanry & Franciscan. 
                        This introduced redundancy by adding secondary routes with higher distance metrics. 
                        For example, at Mount Pleasant, we set up static default routes: <code>ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.255.0.1</code> (to Yeomanry) and <code>ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.255.0.2 distance 10</code> (to Franciscan). 
                        Similar configurations were applied at Franciscan and Chandos Road. 
                        We also configured a new trunk between Mount Pleasant and Franciscan, setting <code>interface 1/1/49</code> at Mount Pleasant with <code>vlan trunk native 1</code> and <code>vlan trunk allowed all</code>, and <code>interface C22</code> at Franciscan with <code>vlan 1 untagged</code> and <code>vlan 2-4094 tagged</code>. 
                        These changes ensure better failover and connectivity, leveraging existing infrastructure now properly connected and configured. 
                        With these updates, the network is starting to feel much more robust, and we’re excited to see the impact as we move forward!

                    <h2 class="blog-title">Week 7</h2>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        Week 7 was all about getting hands-on with new equipment and laying the groundwork for our final implementation phase. 
                        We received the demo equipment from our external supplier, Ubiquiti/UniFi, and were thrilled to learn that this demo gear is ours to keep permanently. 
                        The package included switches and a 5G modem, which will be crucial for connecting the facility to our VPN mesh network. 
                        We spent a significant portion of the week writing and testing configurations in a controlled test environment to ensure everything would work seamlessly once deployed.

                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        Our focus was on preparing the new switches and the 5G modem for integration into the network. 
                        This involved setting up the necessary configurations to connect the facility to the VPN mesh network we’ve been building. 
                        We also started planning the full rack overhaul at The Radcliffe Centre, which includes reorganizing the cabling and implementing proper cable management. 
                        It’s very much a “full hardware mode” week, with a lot of time spent patching, testing, and ensuring the new equipment integrates smoothly with the existing infrastructure.

                    <br>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        Looking ahead, we’re planning to implement these configurations in the final week, likely starting Monday and Tuesday, continuing in hardware mode to wrap up the physical setup. 
                        By Wednesday and Thursday, we’ll shift to “full software mode,” focusing on finalizing configurations, testing the network, and ensuring everything is running smoothly. 
                        We’re also arranging a team dinner on Friday to celebrate the end of the internship and to ensure everyone is up to date with our work. 
                        Our goal is to leave the team with a fully functional, well-documented network and a clear understanding of everything we’ve done. 
                        It’s exciting to see everything coming together, and we’re determined to finish strong!
