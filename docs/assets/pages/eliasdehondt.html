                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        The first week was a bit of a whirlwind, to put it mildly. 
                        The people who were supposed to guide me were off enjoying their vacation, and their replacements didn’t seem quite ready to step in. 
                        So, I found myself spending most of my time researching network monitoring tools on my own and getting familiar with the university. 
                        One highlight, though, was that we got a full tour of all three campuses, which was a great way to see the lay of the land. 
                        It was a lot to take in, but it definitely helped me get a sense of the place. 
                        The staff situation, though? Not exactly ideal—things felt a bit disorganized with the regular crew away and the stand-ins still finding their footing.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        It wasn’t the smoothest start, but it wasn’t a total loss either. 
                        That first week ended up being more about exploration than anything else. 
                        Besides the campus tour, I spent time getting to know everyone, signing a stack of paperwork, and sorting out contracts to get everything in order. 
                        Even with the chaos, I managed to learn a bunch about the network—turns out it’s not in the best shape, so there’s plenty to tackle. 
                        It was also a chance to pick up on the team’s vibe and figure out how everyone fits together. 
                        All in all, Week 1 was a bit all over the place, but it gave me a solid starting point to build from.

                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        Things started looking up by Thursday, though. 
                        We had a meeting with Piet De Boedt, and we finally got the chance to talk to him about our network project. 
                        Up until then, it was all a bit vague, but Thursday was when it started to get concrete. 
                        Joe, our contact person here at the university, was a huge help with this. 
                        He really stepped up and made sure we could finally kick things off. 
                        Thanks to Piet and Joe, we got a clear direction, and by Friday, we even got to visit the campus to take a first look at how the network is set up over there. 
                        It felt good to finally have something solid to dig into after a shaky start. 
                        All in all, Week 1 was a bit all over the place, but it gave me a solid starting point to build from.

                    <h2 class="blog-title">Easter Holidays Week 1</h2>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        The first week of Easter holidays was all about diving into some hands-on work, and it felt good to finally get stuck into something technical. 
                        We spent most of our time working on a Python script that the team here can dynamically apply to different scenarios. 
                        The goal was to create something flexible—something they could use to pull statistics from various sources and display them right on their dashboard. 
                        It’s still a work in progress, but by the end of the week, we had a solid foundation that could read and process data in a way that’s actually useful for them.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        On top of that, we started building a monitoring tool that’s shaping up to be pretty cool. 
                        It’s an executable that lets them log into a switch or router and pull all sorts of info—like interface statuses, performance stats, you name it. 
                        The idea is to give them a quick, easy way to check on the network without digging through a million menus or command lines. 
                        We got the basics working, and it’s already pulling some live data, which was exciting to see. 
                        There’s still some polishing to do, but it’s definitely coming together.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        We also took a trip to Mount Pleasant this week, which was a nice change of pace. 
                        The visit was all about gathering more info for our documentation and digging deeper into the analysis phase of our project. 
                        It was a chance to see some of the network setup in action and take a few “before” pictures—you can check those out in the images section if you’re curious. 
                        The whole experience gave us a better grasp of what we’re working with and helped tie our coding efforts back to the real-world network. 
                        On top of that, we got a fun surprise this week: a new office! It used to belong to the manager who was supposed to welcome us, which we found pretty amusing. 
                        Together with Joe McMorrow, we had a great time pimping it out to make it our own—check out the photos in the <a class="cursor-pointer" href="/assets/pages/images.html">gallery</a> to see the results! 
                        All in all, it was a productive week that balanced coding, fieldwork, and a bit of office flair—definitely a step up from the chaos of Week 1!
