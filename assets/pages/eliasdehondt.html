                    <p class="post-text">The first week was a bit of a whirlwind, to put it mildly. The people who were supposed to guide me were off enjoying their vacation, and their replacements didn’t seem quite ready to step in. So, I found myself spending most of my time researching network monitoring tools on my own and getting familiar with the university. One highlight, though, was that we got a full tour of all three campuses, which was a great way to see the lay of the land. It was a lot to take in, but it definitely helped me get a sense of the place. The staff situation, though? Not exactly ideal—things felt a bit disorganized with the regular crew away and the stand-ins still finding their footing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="post-text">It wasn’t the smoothest start, but it wasn’t a total loss either. That first week ended up being more about exploration than anything else. Besides the campus tour, I spent time getting to know everyone, signing a stack of paperwork, and sorting out contracts to get everything in order. Even with the chaos, I managed to learn a bunch about the network—turns out it’s not in the best shape, so there’s plenty to tackle. It was also a chance to pick up on the team’s vibe and figure out how everyone fits together. All in all, Week 1 was a bit all over the place, but it gave me a solid starting point to build from.</p>
